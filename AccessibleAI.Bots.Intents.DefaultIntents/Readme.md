# AccessibleAI.Bots.Language.Levenshtein

This package involves using [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) to calculate the difference or similarities between strings to resolve intents from utterances.

This package uses [Quickenshtein](https://github.com/Turnerj/Quickenshtein) for fast and simple Levenshtein distance calculation.

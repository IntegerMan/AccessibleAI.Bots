# AccessibleAI Bots Project

The [AccessibleAI](https://AccessibleAI.dev) bot helpers are a series of small utility projects designed to give custom implementations of common functionality in bots.

This project is currently early in development and is expanding and iterating rapidly as it is used to build several bots. 

**Expect massive amounts of change during this phase. Classes may be renamed, moved, deleted. Entire projects may be removed, renamed, or merged together. Critical functionality and documentation may be missing. And *gasp* there may be bugs.**

You have been warned.

## Packages

Presently there are three key pieces of the AccessibleAI Bots Project:

### [AccessibleAI.Bots.Blobs](./AccessibleAI.Bots.Blobs/Readme.md)

This package contains a set of classes that can be used to store conversations in Azure Blob Storage for quality assurance purposes.

AccessibleAI.Bots.Blobs is currently in early development and is not yet ready for use.

### [AccessibleAI.Bots.CluHelpers](./AccessibleAI.Bots.CluHelpers/Readme.md)

CluHelpers exists to help interact with Conversational Language Understanding (CLU) resources on Azure as the Azure SDK support for CLU is still early on in its development.

AccessibleAI.Bots.CluHelpers is currently in early development and is not yet ready for use.

### [AccessibleAI.Bots.Tables](./AccessibleAI.Bots.Tables/Readme.md)

This is a set of utilities built to retrieve output data from Azure Table Storage.
